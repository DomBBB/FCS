# Fundamentals of Computer Science

Welcome to the official EasyPass GitHub page of the course Fundamentals of Computer Science!
As you probably have already experienced, coding is not easy and there is no other way around it than praciting.

Note: To access/run the notebooks just click on the respective Google Colab links. You can also directly clone the notebooks from this repository if you wish.

## Coding Crash Course
In the following Notebook, we will look at the fundamental data types and operations of Python. This can be used as a quick refresher:

## Python Advanced
If you know the basics of Python and want to learn more about advanced topics such as list comprehensions, map(), OOP, lambda functions or Numpy the following notebook might be interesting. This is especially interesting for revising the contents of the Data Science part of the lecture:

## More on Pandas

Pandas and especially pandas' dataframe module is one of the fundamental libraries for data science and machine learning. The following notebook will teach you everything that you need to know (and more) on this topic.
