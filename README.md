##### Welcome to the **official EasyPass GitHub** page for the course Fundamentals of Computer Science @ HSG! The following sections include several notebooks which elaborate on the practical aspects of the course. For a refresher on the theory as well as several exam-relevant exercises check out our extensive summary, which is available [Here](https://easypass.shop/shopping).

Coding is not easy and definitely not intuitive at first. However, since there is no other way around it, this compilation of notebooks provides an interactive overview of essential concepts and helps you to familiarize yourself with the exam relevant material.

***You're a complete beginner?**<br>
Don't worry, we provide material ranging from Python basics up to advanced Machine Learning.


**How should you proceed?**<br>
We strongly encourage you to focus on understanding rather than learning by heart. Therefore, feel free to run, adapt and experiment with the code to get the most out of it. **Remember: Practice makes perfect!**<br>

**What is a Google Colab Notebook?** <br> 
Google Colab provides an easy solution to experiment with your code in your browser. This means there is no need to install anything and collaborating becomes much easier. A Google Colab bases on Jupyter Notebooks. Basically, a notebook consists of text cells with explanations as well as code cells that can be run by pressing either the play button or **Shift+ENTER**. <br><br>
*Note*: If you open our notebooks you can always edit the code without changing the original file, allowing you to practice by yourself. You can even save changes to your personal Google Drive. <br><br>
To access/run the notebooks just click on the respective Google Colab links. If you get the warning  “This notebook was not authored by Google” don’t worry, just press “Run Anyway”.

If you want to know more about Google Colab Notebook, feel free to explore [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) provided by Google.


## Introduction to Python
In the following Notebook, we will look at the fundamental data types and operations of Python. This can be used as a quick refresher before getting into more specific applications:

In case you are a total beginner and have no prior experience with Python, the following notebook may be of additional help:

## Introduction to Object Oriented Programming
With Object-oriented programming (OOP) you can organize software around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object is defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.<br>
The following notebook allows you to apply the theory learnt in the Chapter 3.1.

## Data Science
In Chapter 5 we introduced you to Data Science. The following colabs will give you insights into Data Science Basics, the Pandas Library and Data Visualization.
- Basics ([![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/WahlerP/csfundamentals-hsg/blob/master/Data_Science.ipynb))
- Data Wrangling with Pandas ([![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/WahlerP/csfundamentals-hsg/blob/master/Data_Wrangling_with_Pandas.ipynb))
- Data Visualization [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/WahlerP/csfundamentals-hsg/blob/master/Data_Visualization.ipynb)

## Python Advanced
If you know the basics of Python and want to learn more about advanced topics such as list comprehensions, map(), OOP, lambda functions or Numpy the following notebook might be interesting. This is especially interesting for revising the contents of the Data Science part of the lecture:

## More on Pandas

Pandas and especially pandas' dataframe module is one of the fundamental libraries for data science and machine learning. The following notebook will teach you everything that you need to know (and more) on this topic.
